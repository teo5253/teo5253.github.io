        <div class="para" id="first">
            <p>This is where we began. I remember the first night I talked to you over Hangouts while you were at Grace's house. I remember thinking you were really cute, funny, and unique. Eventually I got your number and we were texting back and forth for 6 months. Then it came time to meet you. I was so scared. Beyond terrified. At this point I had told you I wanted to be just friends so I was so nervous about meeting you. When I saw you, I was super awkward and I didn’t talk. But that was only because you were 100x more beautiful than I thought you would be.  Then, after that , we spent a whole month at 2:22. At first we kind of didn’t talk to each other much. Which felt really weird because I had been talking to you all day every day before that. I was just really nervous, and awkward. The only way we really talked was through our letters. Which I still have! Towards the end of camp, we started to talk more, a lot more. We had quite the scare when we thought we weren’t going to see each other after camp, but we worked it out, and I got to spend 3 of my favorite days ever with you. On my last day (July 31st, 2015), I asked you to be my girlfriend. The best decision I’ve ever made. We cuddled so much that night and it was amazing. I was the happiest guy alive. Still am.</p>

            <p>Reunited after 4 months.</p>

        <div class="para" id="laughshorter">
            <p>Our first 4 months of dating were really hard but they were amazing. Sometimes awkward, but amazing. Mostly it was just hard not being with you. I missed you so much, I cried some nights. And that is saying a lot because back then I didn’t cry much except for at camp. Now I cry a lot. But that moment when I saw you as I was leaving the airport was such a relief. It was so good to see you and give you the huge hug I’d been wanting to give you for ages. I was kinda super awkward at first, but watching the Gladiator and Daddy Day Care/sleeping until 5am was really fun. It just felt so right being back with you. I could’ve stayed there forever.</p>

            <p>And our 5 month &lt;3</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para" id="regroup">
            <p>This was probably the best week of my life so far. It started out pretty rocky. I was awkward. As heck. And just a little mad at Jackson and you for messing with me. But it ended up really great. We got to cuddle again after a long time, we got to hold hands and walk, I got to be with you at midnight on New Years and wish you a happy 5 month. I can’t even describe how happy I was. We had so much fun together just doing whatever we wanted. We even when out late on I don’t even know what day at I don’t even know what time, and I kissed you. The most awkward first kiss like ever, but it was amazing. It felt right. Anna, you and me are unique. We are everything but normal. We live halfway across the country from each other. We are both so weird. We never really do stuff the cliché way that most couples do. At first that kind of bothered me. But you know what, know I’ve realized that is what makes us special. It’s you and me, living a unique life and having fun, not giving two fricks about everything else. Anna, I love you, more then I’ve ever loved someone before, and you mean the world to me. I miss you so much but it’s remembering the moments and the times like that weekend we had together that keep me going. It’s remembering that we are special and unique and that we do things our own way.</p>

        <div class="para" id="facetime">
            <p>After Regroup we decided to Facetime every single night. We did for a really long time and it was always the best part of my day. It still is whenever we Facetime. Just seeing you all happy and dorky and clumsy, being you. Or seeing you sad and being able to comfort you as best I can. Staying up wayyyy too late just talking and talking. Or sitting in complete silence doing the essentials of what’s due tomorrow. I love every minute of it. Sure, sometimes you act like a crackhead, but it’s cute and funny, it’s you. I love you and everything about you. I love how crazy you are. I love how loving you are. I just love you so dang much. I’m in love with you Anna. Happy Valentines Day &lt;3. I can’t wait till the next time I see my beautiful amazing girlfriend. You are everything to me. I love you babe.</p>
